# Stable Diffusion for dummies

Most people reading this have probably heard of image generation at some point in time. If you're among those who haven't, then this journey will be even better as I go in some fair detail to try and explain what it is.

If at any point, the things I talk about seem hard, don't be discouraged as it's more of a shock if you find this easy to read. Nevertheless, buckle up because although we might not go all the way into the deep-end (I don't know enough stuff yet), I think we'll still get to dip our toes.

## Cool pics to pump you up:
I'll just let the images speak.

This blog and deep learning in general have the tendency to contain lots of technical jargon. It might be something stupidly simple once you actually learn what it is, but for some reason the DL community likes cool names I guess. In case you're a bit rusty with some of the terms, I've defined most used in this blog.

If you had to make a guess about how image generation works, what would that guess be? Think for a moment. If you're like me, then you probably thought that we try to get the model to spit out cool looking images, right? Well, not exactly. Bear with me for a moment.
\ 

Imagine a magic function that takes in images of handwritten digits as inputs and spits out the probability that the input is a digit. 
\ 

Let the probability be $P(X)$ for an input Image X.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  I1(X1) --> F((Magic Function))
  I2(X2) --> F
  I3(X3) --> F
  F --> O1("P(X1)")
  F --> O2("P(X2)")
  F --> O3("P(X3)")

```

\

Wait. How do we use this function to generate new digits?\
We do the following steps:\

1. Try making a pixel of X darker and then check the output probability
2. Try making a pixel of X lighter and then check probability
3. Do this for every pixel in X (If X is a 28x28 image, that's 784 times!)

In the above steps, we're calculating the change in probability of the images being handwritten wrt. to each pixel in the image (784 for a 28x28 image), mathematically it can be represented as follows: 
$$\nabla_X P(X)$$
\

::: {.callout-note}
$\nabla_X P(X)$ is itself a vector of size 784.
:::

Next step we do is to multiply $\nabla_X P(X)$ with some constant.
$$c*\nabla_X P(X)$$

Now we subtract the above term from the 784 pixel values of $X$ and in turn increase the output probability, and we do it a bunch of times.\

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  I(X) --> F((Magic Function))
  F --> O("P(X)")
  O --> G["c * ∇ₓP(X)"]
  G --> S["-"]
  S --> I
```
\

Having gone through all that, it would be an intelligent guess to say that now all we need is for someone to give us the magic function so we can start generating.\

But there's some bad news, nobody is going to hand us any magical function that takes care of everything under the hood. We're going to have to train our own neural network on a lot of handwritten data to do this for us.\

Seems simple enough to do for any seasoned DL practitioner. Alas! There's a catch. Now I don't know the why or how, but smarter people than me figured out that it's pretty much practically impossible if not insanely hard to create a metric that tells us how much our image looks like a specific digit. 

:::{.callout-important}
Don't forget that our end goal is making super pretty images like we saw at the start, not some basic digits.
:::
\

So, they decided on an interesting but very logical approach.\

Every image we train on can be overlayed with some random amounts of noise, the result would be a noisier image of course but now we have some place to start with.\
`Noisy Image = Noise + Clear Image`

Wkt we can't predict how much an image looks like something, but turns out we can try and predict how noisy an image is, and then using basic arithmetic we can see that we'd just have to subtract that predicted noise from the noisy image to end up with a relatively Clear Image. \

Passing in a starting pic and repeating this over and over would train our model to get good at predicting the noise in an image and getting rid of it. \

This model is very similar to a U-Net

## Specifics of Training


Probability of Noise:\

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B["Randomly selected sequential noise"] -->  X((+))
    X --> A["Somewhat noisy latent"] --> C(("Diffusion Model"))
    C --> D("Predicted Noise") --> - --> A
    A --> E["Less noisy latent"]
    F["Randomly Selected Noise"] --> Z((+)) --> E -->
    G(("Updated Diffusion Model")) --> H("Predicted Noise")
    H --> Y[-] --> E
```
