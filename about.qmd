## About

Iâ€™m a 20 yr. old CS student with a new found interest for Deep learning. I love writing code and learning concepts that make me tear my hair out ; )

I was introduced to the basics of HTML, CSS and some python in middle school and early high school, but I started programming much more seriously a few months before starting college.

I also share a deep love for core CS concepts and the most recent project I did was related to writing my own little toy language. The languages Iâ€™m comfortable with include Python, C++, C, Javascript (and maybe Java). Other than that Iâ€™m also quite familar with HTML&CSS and am currently learning React as well.

Tech stuff apart, I love reading and listening to music. Current book of mine is The Republic by Plato and my favorite band atm is Nine Inch Nails (Ghosts I-IV ðŸ¤˜).
