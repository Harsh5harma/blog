    "text": "Hey! Iâ€™m Harsh Sharma, a 20 yr old CS student with a new found interest for Deep learning. I love writing code and learning concepts that make me tear my hair out ; )\nI was introduced to the basics of HTML, CSS and some python in middle school and early high school, but I started programming much more seriously a few months before starting college.\nI also share a deep love for core CS concepts and the most recent project I did was related to writing my own little toy language. The languages Iâ€™m comfortable with include Python, C++, C, Javascript (and maybe Java). Other than that Iâ€™m also quite familar with HTML&CSS and am currently learning React as well.\nTech stuff apart, I love reading and listening to music. Current book of mine is The Republic by Plato and my favorite band atm is Nine Inch Nails (Ghosts I-IV ðŸ¤˜)."
