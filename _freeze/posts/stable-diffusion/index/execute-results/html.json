If you're among those who haven't, then this journey will be even better as I go in some fair detail to explain what it is.\n\nIf at any point, the things I talk about seem hard, don't be discouraged as it's more of a shock if you find this easy to read. Nevertheless, buckle up because although we might not go all the way into the deep-end (I don't know enough stuff yet for that), I think we'll still get to dip our toes.\n\n![](buckleup.gif)\n\n## Cool pics to pump you up:\n\n\\\n\nI'll just let the images speak.  \n\n\\\n\n![cozy warm image of an indian male programmer sitting near a beautiful pond, scenic, matches white background, beautiful](img3.jpg)\n\n\\\n\n![Dune arakis in the background.
