If you're among those who haven't, then this journey will be even better as I go in some fair detail to explain what it is.\n\nIf at any point, the things I talk about seem hard, don't be discouraged as it's more of a shock if you find this easy to read. Nevertheless, buckle up because although we might not go all the way into the deep-end (I don't know enough stuff yet for that), I think we'll still get to dip our toes. \n\n![buckleup](buckleup.gif)\n\n\n\n\n### Cool pics to pump you up\nI'll just let the images speak.\n\n\n![buckleup](img1.jpg)\n![buckleup](img3.jpg)\n![buckleup](img4.jpg)\n![buckleup](img5.jpg)\n\nAll of the above were generated with simple but detailed text prompts.\n\n",
